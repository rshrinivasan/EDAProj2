# coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999â€“2008?

# Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.

# From the documentation, the column EI.Sector specifies the sector/source the emissions 
# data are mapped to.
# The following sectors are related to coal combustion
# Fuel Comb - Electric Generation - Coal
# Fuel Comb - Industrial Boilers, ICEs - Coal
# Fuel Comb - Comm/Institutional - Coal

# The period is a reserved word, column names with period in them
# are replaced with an underscore, so EI.Sector transforms to EI_Sector
# Format the sum for better display dividing by 10^5
